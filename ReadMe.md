<b>Problem statement</b>

In mini library management system, the library personnel need to find a book for the customer. 
1. There will be so many books with the same author and the library personnel need to find using alphabetical order.
2. The personnel need to check out few books, and at the same time to record any books being returned by the end as well as to keep track the customerâ€™s information.  This process of searching can be time consuming. 

<b>Task</b>

Create more advance functions to help the library personnel based on the following requirements:
1. To add and keep the book information and borrower information in a file.
2. Allow a customer to borrow a maximum of 5 books.
3. Books that could be loaned must be returned within 5 days starting the day the book was loaned.
4. Assume that each customer can make multiple loans as long as the customer did not exceed the number of books borrowed.
5. Present the books loaned by a customer based on the latest borrowing done.
6. To search and get the information of the borrower when she/he wants to return the book. The search for a customer details is through the customer id which is linked to the   	customer individual profile(customer profile contains information such as customer name, books borrowed and etc).
7. To calculate the overdue penalties based on Table 1 and produce the receipt like shown in Figure 1.
8. Include a menu that allows the customer to choose the operation that the customer wants to perform.
9. To calculate return balance based on amount paid by the customer.
10. To provide reporting function like shown in Figure 2.
11.You are encouraged to use your own creativity and ideas to add functionalities to make your system as functional and user-friendly a possible. For example, you may incorporate borrowed date and returned date to compute the number of days a customer borrows an item.

12. Hence, your program should focus on the topics below 
i. Array 
ii. Pointer 
iii. Basic data structures 
iv. File processing
